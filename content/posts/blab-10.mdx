# Blab-10: Real-Time Chat Platform

Real-time communication is at the heart of modern web applications. Blab-10 is a chat platform that delivers instant messaging with a focus on performance, reliability, and user experience.

## Technical Stack

The platform is built with:
- **Next.js 14**: App Router with React Server Components
- **WebSockets**: For real-time bidirectional communication
- **PostgreSQL**: Message persistence and user data
- **Redis**: Presence tracking and message queuing

## Real-Time Architecture

The key challenge in building a chat app is maintaining consistency between client and server state while providing instant feedback to users.

\`\`\`typescript
// Client-side message sending with optimistic updates
const sendMessage = async (content: string) => {
  const optimisticMessage = {
    id: generateTempId(),
    content,
    userId: currentUser.id,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    status: 'sending'
  }
  
  // Immediately show in UI
  addMessageToUI(optimisticMessage)
  
  try {
    // Send to server
    const result = await ws.send({
      type: 'message',
      data: { content, roomId }
    })
    
    // Update with server confirmation
    updateMessageStatus(optimisticMessage.id, 'sent')
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle failure gracefully
    updateMessageStatus(optimisticMessage.id, 'failed')
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Scaling Considerations

As the user base grows, several scaling strategies become important:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently manage WebSocket connections across multiple server instances
2. **Message Sharding**: Distribute message load across database partitions
3. **Presence Optimization**: Use Redis pub/sub for real-time presence updates without database load

## User Experience Features

Beyond basic messaging, Blab-10 includes:
- **Typing indicators**: See when others are composing messages
- **Read receipts**: Know when messages have been seen
- **Rich media**: Support for images, links, and file uploads
- **Message reactions**: Quick emoji responses to messages

The result is a chat platform that feels instant and responsive, even under heavy load. Building Blab-10 was an excellent exercise in real-time systems design and performance optimization.
