# AskMyPDF — Building a RAG Document Assistant

Building an AI-powered document assistant that understands context and provides accurate answers is a fascinating challenge. In this post, I'll walk through the architecture and key decisions behind AskMyPDF, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that makes PDF documents conversational.

## The Challenge

Traditional search relies on keyword matching, which often misses the semantic meaning of queries. Users might ask "What are the revenue projections?" when the document uses terms like "financial forecast" or "income estimates." A RAG system bridges this gap by understanding intent and context.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Extracts text from PDFs, chunks content intelligently, and generates embeddings
2. **Vector Database**: Stores document embeddings for fast semantic search
3. **LLM Integration**: Combines retrieved context with user queries to generate accurate responses

\`\`\`python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

app = FastAPI()

async def process_document(file: UploadFile):
    # Extract text from PDF
    text = extract_pdf_text(file)
    
    # Split into chunks with overlap
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=1000,
        chunk_overlap=200
    )
    chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
    
    # Generate embeddings and store
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
    vectorstore = Chroma.from_texts(chunks, embeddings)
    
    return vectorstore
\`\`\`

## Key Learnings

Building this system taught me several important lessons:

- **Chunking Strategy Matters**: The size and overlap of text chunks significantly impacts retrieval quality
- **Context Window Management**: Balancing context size with LLM token limits requires careful engineering
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handling malformed PDFs and edge cases is crucial for production use

The result is a system that can answer complex questions about documents with high accuracy, making information more accessible and actionable.
