# Building a Model Context Protocol Calendar Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is revolutionizing how AI assistants interact with external tools and services. In this post, I'll share how I built a calendar server that lets AI assistants manage Google Calendar events naturally.

## What is MCP?

MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external data sources and tools. Instead of building custom integrations for each AI assistant, MCP servers expose capabilities that any MCP-compatible client can use.

## Architecture Overview

The calendar server implements three core MCP operations:

1. **Tools**: Actions the AI can take (create event, update event, delete event)
2. **Resources**: Data the AI can query (upcoming events, calendar availability)
3. **Prompts**: Pre-built templates for common workflows

\`\`\`typescript
import { MCPServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk'
import { google } from 'googleapis'

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: 'google-calendar-mcp',
  version: '1.0.0'
})

// Register calendar tools
server.tool({
  name: 'create_event',
  description: 'Create a new calendar event',
  parameters: {
    summary: { type: 'string', required: true },
    start: { type: 'string', required: true },
    end: { type: 'string', required: true }
  },
  handler: async (params) => {
    const calendar = google.calendar('v3')
    const event = await calendar.events.insert({
      calendarId: 'primary',
      requestBody: {
        summary: params.summary,
        start: { dateTime: params.start },
        end: { dateTime: params.end }
      }
    })
    return { success: true, eventId: event.data.id }
  }
})
\`\`\`

## Authentication Flow

One of the trickiest parts was implementing secure OAuth 2.0 authentication that works seamlessly with the MCP protocol. The server maintains refresh tokens and handles token expiration gracefully.

## Real-World Usage

With this MCP server, users can simply tell their AI assistant:
- "Schedule a team meeting for tomorrow at 2pm"
- "What's on my calendar next week?"
- "Move my 3pm meeting to 4pm"

The AI handles the natural language understanding, while the MCP server manages the actual calendar operations.

This project demonstrates how MCP can bridge the gap between conversational AI and real-world productivity tools.
